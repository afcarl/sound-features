# sound-features
Implementations of a few features for analyzing sound data.

For sound analysis I impolemented a few common sound features in MATLAB: Center frequency (centerFreq.m), Crest Factor (crestFactor.m), Formants (formants.m), Harmonics (harmonics.m), Peak frequency (peak.m), Ratio between two frequency bands (powerratio.m). I do not claim novelty for any of these features, just their implementation. Please cite the respective papers if you use this for your work.
